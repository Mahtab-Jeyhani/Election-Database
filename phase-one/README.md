# The implementation of the database of an online election site
+ The subject of the project is the implementation of an online election site. In this way, different elections (Presidential, Islamic Council, Expert Council and Town and Village Islamic Council) can be held on this site. For each type of election, a number of people register for candidacy in the elections and present their documents and records of their political activities. Then, the judges related to those elections will check the competence of these people, and after approval or rejection, the list of approved people will be available to the public. Each of these elections has a specific period number and a specific period of time (for example, presidential elections are held once every 4 years). Some assumptions of elections in our country are explained below:
+ President of the Republic:
The supervision of these elections is the responsibility of the Guardian Council, and after that, people participate in the elections and vote for their preferred candidates. If in the first stage, no candidate could get the maximum number of votes, the two candidates with the most votes will enter the second stage of the election.

+ Council of the Islamic Council
In these elections, it is the responsibility of the members of the Guardian Council to confirm the authority. Each constituency will have a number of candidates and a specific number of representatives, which will be determined by the votes of the voters of that constituency.

+ Council of experts:
In these elections, it is the responsibility of the members of the Guardian Council to confirm the authority. Each constituency will have a number of candidates and a certain number of representatives, which will be determined by the votes of the voters of that constituency.

+ Islamic councils of cities and villages
In these elections, it is the responsibility of the members of the Islamic Council to confirm the authority. Each constituency will have a number of candidates and a certain number of representatives, which will be determined by the votes of the voters of that constituency.

+ In each election, the council that is responsible for the primary approval has the ability to reject the approved candidate and cancel the ballot. Also, in the case of empty votes or the absence of representatives of some constituencies (for example, due to not reaching the quorum of votes, death, resignation, or rejection of the authority of a representative, etc), mid-term elections for that constituency and leave blank for the representative number.

+ In the first phase of the project, the ER diagram with all entities along with their characteristics and relationships is designed
